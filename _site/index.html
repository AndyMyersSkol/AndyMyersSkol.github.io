    <p>I am a first year Ph.D. student and Stanford Graduate Fellow in Political Science at Stanford University. My research leverages causal inference and machine learning to understand how election systems can be designed to reduce polarization, enhance accountability, and restore faith in elections. I graduated from St. Olaf College before serving as a Predoctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR).</p>

      <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
        The 2020 U.S. election saw high turnout, a huge increase in absentee voting, and brought unified national Democratic control—yet, contrary to much punditry, these facts do not imply that vote-by-mail increased turnout or had major partisan effects. In fact, states newly implementing no-excuse absentee voting for 2020 did not see dramatically larger increases in turnout than states that did not. Focusing on natural experiments in Texas and Indiana, we find that 65-year-olds turned out at nearly the same rate as 64-year-olds, despite voting absentee at higher rates since they didn’t have to provide an excuse to do so. Being old enough to vote no-excuse absentee did not substantially increase Democratic turnout relative to Republican turnout, either. In sum, no-excuse absentee voting seems to have mobilized few voters and had a muted partisan effect despite the historic pandemic. Voter interest appears to be far more important in driving turnout.
